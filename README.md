### About
> This is a completely free public domain software, read more in the end
- **error-key** is use to simplify your project errors & give them unique numbers for easy identification. Quite helpful in case of rest apis where you wish to convey what caused the error & also able to track down the error/bug internally.
- for **APIs** specifically you can also easily fetch `statusCode` to return from your error code ; no more guessing / writing deep logic for exact `statusCode` to send

### Quick Code
* define an object with the following format (learn about the [format  below](#Working))
```
const errorObj = {
	404 : {
		"userNotFound": "userNotFound",
		"orgNotFound": "orgNotFound"
	},
	500 : {
		"unknown: "unknown"
	}
}
```
* next initialize in start of your project
```
const errorKey = require("error-key");

errorKey.initErrors([], errorObj) // initializing
errorKey.keys() // will return object of unique keys with unique codes
errorKey.map() // return object similar to config file with unique code mapping
```

```
// you can simply get unique error code anywhere
try{
	// ....
}catch(err){
	const uniqueCode = errorKey.keys().invalidKey;
	// uniqueCode is a number eg: 4001011 or 5021012
	// read more detail about them below
}
```

### Working
You start by creating a unique configuration object anywhere in your project which you can pass to the `initErrors` object.

- The config file is quite simple to understand. The first nesting is your `statusCode` keys & in each key the error that you wish to declare with both `key` & `value` name similar.
- All common status codes ***(for errors)*** are covered between **400 - 600** although if you wish to use some *other error code* you have to pass it inside `initErrors` function (see [below](#Initialization))
- You can only provide status codes you need and skip the others

> **Note:** The above example (in quick code) is the way your config object should be structured. You will receive an error while initializing if incorrect format is provided.

### Initialization
Simply initialize this anywhere in your project (ofcourse recommended way is in the very start itself)

- `initErrors(codes, config)`
    - ***codes***  : array of `numbers` - if you wish to provide custom `statusCodes` (provide `[]` if no custom codes)
        - example:  `init([888,999], errorObj)`
    - ***config***: your configuration object (learn about config object above)
        - example: `init([], errorObj)`
