**error-key** is use to simplify your project errors & give them unique numbers for easy identification. Quite helpful in case of rest apis where you wish to convey what caused the error & also able to track down the error/bug internally.

### Timeline
Working on a way to make this package easy to use in any kind of project. Expected **timeline** is around May-June '21 but can't guarantee.
